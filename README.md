Build Engineer Exercise
=======================

1. Create a new project on github.com
2. Connect your Github project to travis-ci.org to run your tests
3. Implement Part One, Two and Three of Kata04: http://codekata.com/kata/kata04-data-munging/

Send your travis-ci build page to it@chemaxon.com .
On the face to face interview we will talk about the Kata Questions.

A Java solution is strongly preferred.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is the following:

- Use Gradle wrapper
- Set up a basic project
- Package your project, complete with manifest information
- Have a proper dependency handling to external libraries
- Publish Test Report, also, print test execution outcome to command line so it's visible on the Travis CI console log

Otherwise complete a similar task with your favourite language.
